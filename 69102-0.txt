THE MOON


Except for occasional comets and meteors, the Moon is the celestial
body nearest the Earth. Its mean distance from the Earth is 237,640
miles, but as it moves in an elliptical orbit, it has at one point
a remoteness of 253,263 miles and opposite to this one of 221,436
miles. The diameter of the Moon is about one-fourth that of the Earth,
or 2,160 miles, and its volume is 1/49 that of the Earth. The mass
of the Moon (volume multiplied by density) is 1/81 and the density
⅗ that of the Earth. The period of the Moon's revolution about the
Earth is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 11½ seconds. As its period
of rotation on its axis is the same, only one side of the Moon is ever
seen from the Earth. Since, however, the Moon's axis is inclined about
83° to the plane of its orbit, we sometimes see a little distance
beyond each of its poles, and, since the rate of motion of the Moon
in its orbit varies slightly, we sometimes see a little beyond the
eastern and western edges of the hemisphere. The total result of these
_librations_, as they are called, is to make four-sevenths of the
Moon's surface visible to us. Of the remaining three-sevenths, nothing
is known. So far as is known, the Moon is not flattened at the poles.

Owing to its slow rotation on its axis, the Moon's day has a length of
29½ of our days. Each portion of its surface is therefore exposed to or
shielded from the light of the Sun for a fortnight continuously.

The Moon has no atmosphere. Hence, it can have no diffused light, and
nothing can be seen on it except where the Sun's rays shine directly.
"If a man stepped into the shadow of a lunar crag," says Todd, "he
would instantly become invisible. For a similar reason, no sound,
however loud, can be heard on the Moon. The rolling of a rock down the
wall of a lunar crater, will be known only by the tremor it produces."
Moreover, changes of temperature on the Moon are rapid and violent.
Where the Sun's rays strike, a temperature about that of boiling water
is believed to be reached, while in unilluminated portions it is
thought to go as low as 100° below zero.

The force of gravity upon the surface of the Moon is only ⅙ of that on
the Earth. Therefore, a man weighing 150 pounds on the Earth, would
weigh only 25 pounds on the Moon, and the same muscular energy by which
he could jump 6 feet on the Earth would carry him a distance of 36 feet
on the Moon. On the Earth a body falls 16 feet in one second; on the
Moon only 2.6 feet in the same time.

The surface of the Moon is made up of mountains, valleys and plains,
resembling in general appearance those of the Earth. As a whole,
however, the surface of the Moon is much more uneven than that of the
Earth. Some of the mountains of the Moon have a height of over 20,000
feet. As there is no sea-level to measure from, this figure expresses
height above the surrounding surface, it being determined by the length
of the shadows cast by the mountains.

In order to represent in a vivid and accurate manner the character and
appearance of the Moon's surface, the construction of a large model of
the Moon was undertaken a number of years ago by Th. Dickert, Curator
of the Natural History Museum of Bonn, Germany and Dr. J. F. Julius
Schmidt, Director of the Observatory of Athens, Greece and an eminent
selenographer. The model was presented to the Museum by the late Lewis
Reese of Chicago, and is installed at the west end of Hall 35 of the
Museum. The model is 19.2 feet in diameter, and is by far the largest
and most elaborate representation of the Moon's surface ever made. Its
horizontal scale is 1:600,000, one inch on the model equaling 9-47/100
miles on the surface of the Moon, and its vertical scale is 1:200,000,
one inch equaling 3-15/100 miles on the Moon.

Some characteristic features of the Moon's surface which are especially
well illustrated on the model are the following:

1. GRAY PLAINS or "SEAS." These are the darker portions of the Moon's
surface as it is seen with the naked eye. They were thought by earlier
observers to be seas and were so named. We now know, however, that
there is no water on the Moon's surface and that the so-called "seas"
are really low-land plains, some of them of vast extent. The Oceanus
Procellarum, for instance, covers an area of 90,000 square miles.
As seen from the Earth, the plains show a gray-green color, often
of varying intensity and sometimes a little bluish in portions. The
brightest green color is shown by the area known as Mare Serenitatis.
Though appearing perfectly level, a close study shows that these plains
have undulating surfaces. They occupy about one-third of the visible
surface of the Moon.

2. MOUNTAINS and HIGHLANDS. These constitute the bright portions of the
Moon's surface as it is seen with the naked eye.

Although these elevated areas are conveniently called mountains, Shaler
has drawn attention to the fact that they are unlike those on the
Earth since they lack features due to erosion and there is absence of
order in their association. The average declivity of their slopes is
also much greater than that of the mountains on the Earth. It has been
estimated that the average angle of the lunar surface to its horizon is
52°, while on the Earth it does not amount to more than one-tenth of
that figure. This difference is probably due to the lack of water on
the Moon, the work of which on the Earth tends continually to reduce
slopes to a level. Using the term mountains for convenience, however,
those on the Moon may be divided into the following classes:

_a._ MOUNTAIN CHAINS. These may have a length of 80 to 100 miles and
heights of from 5,000 to 17,000 feet. As in the case with the mountains
of the Earth, they are usually steeper on one side than on the other.
The range called the Appenines, seen near the north pole of the Moon,
is a good illustration of such mountain chains. Other ranges are the
so-called Alps and Caucasus. These names were applied by Hevelius, an
astronomer of Danzig, who made the first map of the Moon in 1647. He
gave to the features of the Moon's surface names of localities similar
to those on the Earth which they most resembled. His system was largely
abandoned by later astronomers, however, the later method being to name
the different features of the Moon after celebrated astronomers and
philosophers.

_b._ HIGHLANDS SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS. These are partly with and
partly without well-determined directions.

_c._ ISOLATED MOUNTAINS. These usually occur on the gray plains. They
vary from 4,000 to 7,000 feet in height.

_d._ VEIN MOUNTAINS. These occur only on the gray plains. They are
long, narrow, contorted ridges, usually from 700 to 1,000 feet in
height.

_e._ CIRCULAR MOUNTAINS. These are the most characteristic and peculiar
features of the Moon's surface. They vary in size from the so-called
"Walled Plains," 150 to 15 miles in diameter, to crater mountains whose
diameters range from 15 miles down to a few hundred feet. Thirty-three
thousand of these crater mountains have been counted by one astronomer,
the number increasing as the size diminishes.

The form of these craters is that of pits, which generally have
ring-like walls about them. These wails slope very steeply to a central
cavity and more gently toward the surrounding country. In all these
pits, as pointed out by Shaler, except those of the smallest size,
and possibly in these, also, there is, within the ring wall and at a
considerable though variable depth below its summit, a nearly flat
floor, which often has a central pit of small size or, in its place,
a steep cone. When this floor is more than 20 miles in diameter, and
in increasing numbers as it is wider, there are generally other pits
and cones irregularly scattered upon it. Thus, within the ring called
Plato, which is about 60 miles in diameter, there are some scores of
these lesser pits. On the interior of the ring walls of the pits over
10 miles in diameter, there are usually more or less distinct terraces,
which suggest that the material now forming the solid floors they
inclose was once fluid and stood at greater heights in the pit than
that at which it became permanently frozen. It is, indeed, tolerably
certain that the last movement of this material of the floors was one
of interrupted subsidence from an originally greater elevation on
the outside of the ring wall. The ring wall is commonly of irregular
height, with many peaks. In some places there may be seen tongues or
protrusions of the substance which forms the ring, as if it had flowed
a short distance and then had cooled with steep slopes. It may also
be noted: (_a_) that the pits or craters in many instances intersect
each other, showing that they were not all formed at the same time,
but in succession; (_b_) that the larger of them are not found on the
plains (seas) but on the upland and apparently the older parts of the
surface; and (_c_) that the evidence from the intersections clearly
indicates that the larger of these structures are prevailingly the
older and that in general the smallest were the latest formed. In other
words, says Shaler, whatever was the nature of the action involved in
the production of the craters, its energy diminished with time, until
in the end it could no longer break the crust. These features indicate
that the surface of the Moon has been subject to forces similar to
those which produce volcanoes on the Earth, and it is therefore
customary to refer to the crater-like mountains of the Moon as
volcanoes. As the parallel cannot be drawn too closely, however, Shaler
has urged that the term vulcanoids, meaning volcano-like, be applied to
these mountains.

3. RILLS or CLEFTS. These are small, deep, ditch-like furrows to be
found over various parts of the Moon's surface. Their course seems
quite independent of the surface topography, for they traverse
mountains and plains with equal facility. They are without doubt the
latest formation on the Moon and some of them may have had their origin
in modern times.

4. BRIGHT STREAKS. These radiate prominently from many of the great
craters of the Moon. They are streaks of narrow width but sometimes
nearly a hundred miles in length. They are perhaps the most puzzling
of all the Moon's features. They have been supposed by some observers
to represent lava flows whose surface reflected light more brilliantly
than other portions of the Moon. It is more generally believed,
however, that the streaks do not represent any independent elevations,
since they run over the highest mountains as well as through the
deepest craters without variation.




GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.


The condition of the Moon's surface as a whole indicates that it has
been a theater of extraordinary volcanic activity. In size and number
its vulcanoids far exceed the volcanoes of the Earth. The largest
terrestrial crater known is that of Kilauea in the Hawaiian Islands
which is 2½ miles in diameter. Several craters of the Moon, however,
exceed 50 miles in diameter and one measures 114¼ miles. While the
absolute heights of the mountains of the Moon do not greatly exceed
those of the Earth, proportionally they are much higher, since the
Moon's diameter is only one-fourth that of the Earth. The vulcanoids
of the Moon differ in other respects from the volcanoes of our globe.
"On the Earth they are usually openings on the summits or sides of
mountains--on the Moon, depressions below the adjacent surface even
when it is a plain or valley; on the Earth the mass of the cone usually
far exceeds the capacity of the crater--on the Moon they are much
nearer equality; on the Earth they are commonly the sources of long
lava streams--on the Moon, traces of such outpourings are rare." (Webb.)




DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL FEATURES.

(Abridged from Nasmyth and Carpenter.)

The numbers refer to those on the accompanying chart.


COPERNICUS. 147. This may deservedly be considered one of the grandest
and most instructive of lunar craters. Though its diameter (46 miles)
is exceeded by that of other craters, its situation near the center
of the lunar disc renders it so conspicuous as to make it a favorite
object for observation. Its vast rampart rises to upwards of 12,000
feet above the level of the plateau, nearly in the center of which
stands a magnificent group of cones attaining the height of upwards
of 2400 feet. The rampart is divided by concentric segmented terraced
ridges, which present every appearance of being enormous landslips,
resulting from the crushing of their overloaded summits which have
slid down in vast segments and scattered their debris on the plateau.
Corresponding vacancies in the rampart may be observed from whence
these prodigious masses have broken away. The same may be noticed, to
a somewhat modified degree, around the exterior of the rampart. For
upwards of 70 miles around Copernicus myriads of comparatively minute
but perfectly formed craters can be seen. The district on the southeast
side is especially rich in them. Many somewhat radial ridges or spurs
may be observed leading away from the exterior banks of the great
rampart. They appear to be due to the freer egress which the extruded
matter found near the focus of disruption.

TRIESNECKER. 150. A fine example of a normal lunar volcanic crater
having all the usual characteristic features in great perfection.
Its diameter is about 20 miles and it possesses a good example of
the central cone and also of interior terracing. The most notable
feature, however, is the remarkable display of cracks or chasms which
may be seen to the west side of it. Several of these cracks obviously
diverge from near the west external bank of the great crater and they
sub-divide or branch out as they extend from the apparent point of
divergence, while they are crossed or intersected by others. These
cracks or chasms are nearly one mile wide at their widest part and
after extending for fully 100 miles taper away till they become
invisible.

THEOPHILUS. 97. CYRILLUS. 96. CATHARINA. 95. These three magnificent
craters form a conspicuous group. Their diameters and depths are as
follows: Theophilus, diameter, 64 miles; depth of interior plateau
from summit of crater wall, 16,000 feet; central cone, 5200 feet high;
Cyrillus, diameter, 60 miles; depth of interior plateau from summit
of crater wall, 15,000 feet; central cone, 5800 feet high; Catharina,
diameter, 65 miles; depth of interior plateau from summit of crater
wall, 13,000 feet; center of plateau occupied by a confused group of
minor craters and debris. Each of these craters is full of interesting
details presenting in every variety the characteristic features of the
lunar volcanoes and giving unmistakable evidence of the tremendous
energy which at some remote period piled up such gigantic formations.
The intrusion of Theophilus within Cyrillus shows that it is of more
recent formation than the latter. The flanks of Theophilus, especially
on the west side, are studded with apparently minute craters. These
would be considered of great size but for the enormous crater so near.

PTOLEMY. 111. ALPHONS. 110. ARZACHAEL. 84. The portion of the moon's
surface which includes these features, being near the center of the
lunar disc, is exceptionally well placed for observation. Within
this area may be seen every variety of volcanic craters and a number
of other interesting forms. Ptolemy belongs to the class of walled
plains, its ramparts enclosing a plain 86 miles in diameter. Alphons
and Arzachael are respectively 60 and 55 miles in diameter. They have
all the distinctive features of lunar craters, viz:--central cones,
lofty, ragged ramparts, manifestations of landslip formations in the
great segmental terraces within their ramparts and minor craters
interpolated within their plateaus. A notable object near Alphons is
an enormous straight cliff traversing the diameter of a low, ridged,
circular formation. This great cliff is 60 miles long and from 1000 to
2000 feet high. It is a well known object to lunar observers and has
been termed "The Railway" on account of its straightness. The existence
of this remarkable cliff appears to be due either to an upheaval or a
down-sinking of a portion of the surface of the circular area across
whose diameter it extends.

TYCHO. 80. This magnificent crater is 54 miles in diameter and upwards
of 16,000 feet deep from the highest ridge of the rampart to the
surface of the plateau. It is one of the most conspicuous of lunar
craters, not so much on account of its dimensions as from its occupying
the great focus of disruption from whence diverge those remarkable
bright streaks many of which may be traced over 1000 miles of the
moon's surface. The interior of the crater presents striking examples
of the concentric, terrace-like formations that are regarded as formed
by landslips.

WARGENTIN. 26. SCHICKARD. 28. Wargentin is an object quite unique of
its kind--a crater about 52 miles across, that to all appearance has
been filled to the brim with lava that has been left to consolidate.
There are evidences of the remains of a rampart, especially on the
southwest portion of the rim. The general aspect of Wargentin has been
compared to that of a "thin cheese." The terraced and rutted exterior
of the rampart has all the details of a true crater. The surface of
the high plateau is marked by a few ridges branching from a point
nearly in the center.

Schickard is one of the finest examples of a walled plain. It is 153
miles in diameter. Within its rampart are 16 smaller craters and
without, numberless others.

Transcriber Note

The list of "topographic features" (pp. 11-12) have some numbers
missing (115, 116) and a comparison with Nasmyth and Carpenter's The
Moon was missing those numbers but several other numbers were repeated.
The repeated numbers appear to represent craters too close to split out.

United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
