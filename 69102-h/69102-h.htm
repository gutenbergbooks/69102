<h1 id="THE_MOON">THE MOON</h1>


<p>Except for occasional comets and meteors, the
Moon is the celestial body nearest the Earth. Its mean
distance from the Earth is 237,640 miles, but as it
moves in an elliptical orbit, it has at one point a
remoteness of 253,263 miles and opposite to this
one of 221,436 miles. The diameter of the Moon is
about one-fourth that of the Earth, or 2,160 miles,
and its volume is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>49</sub> that of the Earth. The mass of
the Moon (volume multiplied by density) is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>81</sub> and
the density ⅗ that of the Earth. The period of the
Moon's revolution about the Earth is 27 days, 7 hours,
43 minutes and 11½ seconds. As its period of rotation
on its axis is the same, only one side of the Moon
is ever seen from the Earth. Since, however, the
Moon's axis is inclined about 83° to the plane of its
orbit, we sometimes see a little distance beyond each
of its poles, and, since the rate of motion of the Moon
in its orbit varies slightly, we sometimes see a little
beyond the eastern and western edges of the hemisphere.
The total result of these <i>librations</i>, as they
are called, is to make four-sevenths of the Moon's surface
visible to us. Of the remaining three-sevenths,
nothing is known. So far as is known, the Moon is
not flattened at the poles.</p>

<p>Owing to its slow rotation on its axis, the Moon's
day has a length of 29½ of our days. Each portion
of its surface is therefore exposed to or shielded from
the light of the Sun for a fortnight continuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span></p>

<p>The Moon has no atmosphere. Hence, it can have
no diffused light, and nothing can be seen on it except
where the Sun's rays shine directly. "If a man stepped
into the shadow of a lunar crag," says Todd, "he would
instantly become invisible. For a similar reason, no
sound, however loud, can be heard on the Moon. The
rolling of a rock down the wall of a lunar crater, will
be known only by the tremor it produces." Moreover,
changes of temperature on the Moon are rapid and
violent. Where the Sun's rays strike, a temperature
about that of boiling water is believed to be reached,
while in unilluminated portions it is thought to go as
low as 100° below zero.</p>

<p>The force of gravity upon the surface of the Moon
is only ⅙ of that on the Earth. Therefore, a man
weighing 150 pounds on the Earth, would weigh only
25 pounds on the Moon, and the same muscular energy
by which he could jump 6 feet on the Earth would
carry him a distance of 36 feet on the Moon. On the
Earth a body falls 16 feet in one second; on the Moon
only 2.6 feet in the same time.</p>

<p>The surface of the Moon is made up of mountains,
valleys and plains, resembling in general appearance
those of the Earth. As a whole, however, the surface
of the Moon is much more uneven than that of the
Earth. Some of the mountains of the Moon have a
height of over 20,000 feet. As there is no sea-level to
measure from, this figure expresses height above the
surrounding surface, it being determined by the length
of the shadows cast by the mountains.</p>

<p>In order to represent in a vivid and accurate
manner the character and appearance of the Moon's
surface, the construction of a large model of the Moon
was undertaken a number of years ago by Th. Dickert,
Curator of the Natural History Museum of Bonn, Germany
and Dr. J. F. Julius Schmidt, Director of the
Observatory of Athens, Greece and an eminent selenographer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
The model was presented to the Museum
by the late Lewis Reese of Chicago, and is installed at
the west end of Hall 35 of the Museum. The model is
19.2 feet in diameter, and is by far the largest and
most elaborate representation of the Moon's surface
ever made. Its horizontal scale is 1:600,000, one inch
on the model equaling 9<sup>47</sup>/<sub>100</sub> miles on the surface of
the Moon, and its vertical scale is 1:200,000, one inch
equaling 3<sup>15</sup>/<sub>100</sub> miles on the Moon.</p>

<p>Some characteristic features of the Moon's surface
which are especially well illustrated on the model
are the following:</p>

<p>1. GRAY PLAINS or "SEAS." These are the
darker portions of the Moon's surface as it is seen
with the naked eye. They were thought by earlier
observers to be seas and were so named. We now
know, however, that there is no water on the Moon's
surface and that the so-called "seas" are really low-land
plains, some of them of vast extent. The Oceanus
Procellarum, for instance, covers an area of 90,000
square miles. As seen from the Earth, the plains
show a gray-green color, often of varying intensity
and sometimes a little bluish in portions. The brightest
green color is shown by the area known as Mare
Serenitatis. Though appearing perfectly level, a close
study shows that these plains have undulating surfaces.
They occupy about one-third of the visible surface
of the Moon.</p>

<p>2. MOUNTAINS and HIGHLANDS. These constitute
the bright portions of the Moon's surface as
it is seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Although these elevated areas are conveniently
called mountains, Shaler has drawn attention to the
fact that they are unlike those on the Earth since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
they lack features due to erosion and there is absence
of order in their association. The average declivity of
their slopes is also much greater than that of the
mountains on the Earth. It has been estimated that
the average angle of the lunar surface to its horizon
is 52°, while on the Earth it does not amount to more
than one-tenth of that figure. This difference is probably
due to the lack of water on the Moon, the work
of which on the Earth tends continually to reduce
slopes to a level. Using the term mountains for convenience,
however, those on the Moon may be divided
into the following classes:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Mountain Chains.</span> These may have a length
of 80 to 100 miles and heights of from 5,000 to 17,000
feet. As in the case with the mountains of the Earth,
they are usually steeper on one side than on the other.
The range called the Appenines, seen near the north
pole of the Moon, is a good illustration of such mountain
chains. Other ranges are the so-called Alps and
Caucasus. These names were applied by Hevelius, an
astronomer of Danzig, who made the first map of the
Moon in 1647. He gave to the features of the Moon's
surface names of localities similar to those on the
Earth which they most resembled. His system was
largely abandoned by later astronomers, however, the
later method being to name the different features of
the Moon after celebrated astronomers and philosophers.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Highlands Surrounded By Mountains.</span> These are
partly with and partly without well-determined directions.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">Isolated Mountains.</span> These usually occur on
the gray plains. They vary from 4,000 to 7,000 feet
in height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span></p>

<p><i>d.</i> <span class="smcap">Vein Mountains.</span> These occur only on the gray
plains. They are long, narrow, contorted ridges, usually
from 700 to 1,000 feet in height.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <span class="smcap">Circular Mountains.</span> These are the most characteristic
and peculiar features of the Moon's surface.
They vary in size from the so-called "Walled
Plains," 150 to 15 miles in diameter, to crater mountains
whose diameters range from 15 miles down to a
few hundred feet. Thirty-three thousand of these
crater mountains have been counted by one astronomer,
the number increasing as the size diminishes.</p>

<p>The form of these craters is that of pits, which
generally have ring-like walls about them. These
wails slope very steeply to a central cavity and more
gently toward the surrounding country. In all these
pits, as pointed out by Shaler, except those of the
smallest size, and possibly in these, also, there is, within
the ring wall and at a considerable though variable
depth below its summit, a nearly flat floor, which often
has a central pit of small size or, in its place, a
steep cone. When this floor is more than 20 miles
in diameter, and in increasing numbers as it is wider,
there are generally other pits and cones irregularly
scattered upon it. Thus, within the ring called Plato,
which is about 60 miles in diameter, there are some
scores of these lesser pits. On the interior of the
ring walls of the pits over 10 miles in diameter, there
are usually more or less distinct terraces, which suggest
that the material now forming the solid floors
they inclose was once fluid and stood at greater heights
in the pit than that at which it became permanently
frozen. It is, indeed, tolerably certain that the last
movement of this material of the floors was one of
interrupted subsidence from an originally greater
elevation on the outside of the ring wall. The ring
wall is commonly of irregular height, with many peaks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
In some places there may be seen tongues or protrusions
of the substance which forms the ring, as if it
had flowed a short distance and then had cooled with
steep slopes. It may also be noted: (<i>a</i>) that the pits
or craters in many instances intersect each other,
showing that they were not all formed at the same
time, but in succession; (<i>b</i>) that the larger of them
are not found on the plains (seas) but on the upland
and apparently the older parts of the surface; and
(<i>c</i>) that the evidence from the intersections clearly
indicates that the larger of these structures are prevailingly
the older and that in general the smallest
were the latest formed. In other words, says Shaler,
whatever was the nature of the action involved in
the production of the craters, its energy diminished
with time, until in the end it could no longer break the
crust. These features indicate that the surface of
the Moon has been subject to forces similar to those
which produce volcanoes on the Earth, and it is therefore
customary to refer to the crater-like mountains
of the Moon as volcanoes. As the parallel cannot be
drawn too closely, however, Shaler has urged that the
term vulcanoids, meaning volcano-like, be applied to
these mountains.</p>

<p>3. RILLS or CLEFTS. These are small, deep,
ditch-like furrows to be found over various parts of
the Moon's surface. Their course seems quite independent
of the surface topography, for they traverse
mountains and plains with equal facility. They are
without doubt the latest formation on the Moon and
some of them may have had their origin in modern
times.</p>

<p>4. BRIGHT STREAKS. These radiate prominently
from many of the great craters of the Moon.
They are streaks of narrow width but sometimes
nearly a hundred miles in length. They are perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
the most puzzling of all the Moon's features. They
have been supposed by some observers to represent
lava flows whose surface reflected light more brilliantly
than other portions of the Moon. It is more generally
believed, however, that the streaks do not represent
any independent elevations, since they run over the
highest mountains as well as through the deepest
craters without variation.</p>

</div>


<p>The condition of the Moon's surface as a whole
indicates that it has been a theater of extraordinary
volcanic activity. In size and number its vulcanoids
far exceed the volcanoes of the Earth. The largest
terrestrial crater known is that of Kilauea in the
Hawaiian Islands which is 2½ miles in diameter.
Several craters of the Moon, however, exceed 50 miles
in diameter and one measures 114¼ miles. While the
absolute heights of the mountains of the Moon do not
greatly exceed those of the Earth, proportionally they
are much higher, since the Moon's diameter is only
one-fourth that of the Earth. The vulcanoids of the
Moon differ in other respects from the volcanoes of
our globe. "On the Earth they are usually openings
on the summits or sides of mountains—on the Moon,
depressions below the adjacent surface even when it
is a plain or valley; on the Earth the mass of the
cone usually far exceeds the capacity of the crater —
on the Moon they are much nearer equality; on the
Earth they are commonly the sources of long lava
streams—on the Moon, traces of such outpourings are
rare." (Webb.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copernicus.</span> 147. This may deservedly be considered
one of the grandest and most instructive of
lunar craters. Though its diameter (46 miles) is exceeded
by that of other craters, its situation near
the center of the lunar disc renders it so conspicuous
as to make it a favorite object for observation. Its
vast rampart rises to upwards of 12,000 feet above
the level of the plateau, nearly in the center of which
stands a magnificent group of cones attaining the
height of upwards of 2400 feet. The rampart is divided
by concentric segmented terraced ridges, which
present every appearance of being enormous landslips,
resulting from the crushing of their overloaded summits
which have slid down in vast segments and
scattered their debris on the plateau. Corresponding
vacancies in the rampart may be observed from whence
these prodigious masses have broken away. The same
may be noticed, to a somewhat modified degree, around
the exterior of the rampart. For upwards of 70 miles
around Copernicus myriads of comparatively minute
but perfectly formed craters can be seen. The district
on the southeast side is especially rich in them. Many
somewhat radial ridges or spurs may be observed leading
away from the exterior banks of the great rampart.
They appear to be due to the freer egress which the
extruded matter found near the focus of disruption.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Triesnecker.</span> 150. A fine example of a normal
lunar volcanic crater having all the usual characteristic
features in great perfection. Its diameter is
about 20 miles and it possesses a good example of the
central cone and also of interior terracing. The most
notable feature, however, is the remarkable display
of cracks or chasms which may be seen to the west
side of it. Several of these cracks obviously diverge
from near the west external bank of the great crater
and they sub-divide or branch out as they extend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
from the apparent point of divergence, while they are
crossed or intersected by others. These cracks or
chasms are nearly one mile wide at their widest part
and after extending for fully 100 miles taper away
till they become invisible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theophilus.</span> 97. <span class="smcap">Cyrillus.</span> 96. <span class="smcap">Catharina.</span> 95.
These three magnificent craters form a conspicuous
group. Their diameters and depths are as follows:
Theophilus, diameter, 64 miles; depth of interior
plateau from summit of crater wall, 16,000 feet;
central cone, 5200 feet high; Cyrillus, diameter, 60
miles; depth of interior plateau from summit of
crater wall, 15,000 feet; central cone, 5800 feet high;
Catharina, diameter, 65 miles; depth of interior plateau
from summit of crater wall, 13,000 feet; center
of plateau occupied by a confused group of minor craters
and debris. Each of these craters is full of interesting
details presenting in every variety the characteristic
features of the lunar volcanoes and giving
unmistakable evidence of the tremendous energy
which at some remote period piled up such gigantic
formations. The intrusion of Theophilus within Cyrillus
shows that it is of more recent formation than
the latter. The flanks of Theophilus, especially on the
west side, are studded with apparently minute craters.
These would be considered of great size but for the
enormous crater so near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptolemy.</span> 111. <span class="smcap">Alphons.</span> 110. <span class="smcap">Arzachael.</span> 84. The
portion of the moon's surface which includes these
features, being near the center of the lunar disc, is
exceptionally well placed for observation. Within this
area may be seen every variety of volcanic craters
and a number of other interesting forms. Ptolemy
belongs to the class of walled plains, its ramparts enclosing
a plain 86 miles in diameter. Alphons and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
Arzachael are respectively 60 and 55 miles in diameter.
They have all the distinctive features of lunar craters,
viz:—central cones, lofty, ragged ramparts, manifestations
of landslip formations in the great segmental
terraces within their ramparts and minor craters interpolated
within their plateaus. A notable object
near Alphons is an enormous straight cliff traversing
the diameter of a low, ridged, circular formation. This
great cliff is 60 miles long and from 1000 to 2000
feet high. It is a well known object to lunar observers
and has been termed "The Railway" on account of
its straightness. The existence of this remarkable
cliff appears to be due either to an upheaval or a down-sinking
of a portion of the surface of the circular area
across whose diameter it extends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tycho.</span> 80. This magnificent crater is 54 miles in
diameter and upwards of 16,000 feet deep from the
highest ridge of the rampart to the surface of the
plateau. It is one of the most conspicuous of lunar
craters, not so much on account of its dimensions as
from its occupying the great focus of disruption from
whence diverge those remarkable bright streaks many
of which may be traced over 1000 miles of the moon's
surface. The interior of the crater presents striking
examples of the concentric, terrace-like formations
that are regarded as formed by landslips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wargentin.</span> 26. <span class="smcap">Schickard</span>. 28. Wargentin is an
object quite unique of its kind—a crater about 52
miles across, that to all appearance has been filled
to the brim with lava that has been left to consolidate.
There are evidences of the remains of a
rampart, especially on the southwest portion of the
rim. The general aspect of Wargentin has been compared
to that of a "thin cheese." The terraced and
rutted exterior of the rampart has all the details of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
true crater. The surface of the high plateau is marked
by a few ridges branching from a point nearly in the
center.</p>

<p>Schickard is one of the finest examples of a walled
plain. It is 153 miles in diameter. Within its rampart
are 16 smaller craters and without, numberless
others.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
